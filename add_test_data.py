Had he followed form—had he asked his\nmother to speak to his father to approach a\ngo-between—would Chie have been more receptive?\nHe came on a winter’s eve. He pounded on the\ndoor while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda,\nso at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid\nknew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps,\nthe creak of the door. Then the maid brought a\ncalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.\nChie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she\nwas feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at\na low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt\nspread over the sides of the table so their legs were\ntucked inside with the heat.\n“Who is it at this hour, in this weather?” Chie\nquestioned as she picked the name card off the\nmaid’s lacquer tray.\n“Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College,” she read.\nNaomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft\nintake of air.\n“I think you should go,” said Naomi.\nAkira was waiting in the entry. He was in his early\ntwenties, slim and serious, wearing the black\nmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he\nbowed—his hands hanging straight down, a\nblack cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the\nother—Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening\nsurface of the courtyard’s rain-drenched paving\nstones, she saw his reflection like a dark double.\n“Madame,” said Akira, “forgive my disruption,\nbut I come with a matter of urgency.”\nHis voice was soft, refined. He straightened and\nstole a deferential peek at her face.\nIn the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity.\nChie felt herself starting to like him.\n“Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely\nyour business can wait for a moment or two.”\n“I don’t want to trouble you. Normally I would\napproach you more properly but I’ve received word\nof a position. I’ve an opportunity to go to America, as\ndentist for Seattle’s Japanese community.”\n“Congratulations,” Chie said with amusement.\n“That is an opportunity, I’m sure. But how am I\ninvolved?”\nEven noting Naomi’s breathless reaction to the\nname card, Chie had no idea. Akira’s message,\ndelivered like a formal speech, filled her with\nmaternal amusement. You know how children speak\nso earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about\nthings that have no importance in an adult’s mind?\nThat’s how she viewed him, as a child.\nIt was how she viewed Naomi. Even though\nNaomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts\nneeded to make a good marriage, Chie had made no\neffort to find her a husband.\nAkira blushed.\n“Depending on your response, I may stay in\nJapan. I’ve come to ask for Naomi’s hand.”\nSuddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night.\n“Does Naomi know anything of your...\nambitions?”\n“We have an understanding. Please don’t judge\nmy candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I\nask directly because the use of a go-between takes\nmuch time. Either method comes down to the same\nthing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your\nconsent, I become Naomi’s yoshi.* We’ll live in the\nHouse of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to\nAmerica, to secure a new home for my bride.”\nEager to make his point, he’d been looking her full\nin the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. “I see\nI’ve startled you. My humble apologies. I’ll take no\nmore of your evening. My address is on my card. If\nyou don’t wish to contact me, I’ll reapproach you in\ntwo weeks’ time. Until then, good night.”\nHe bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless\ngrace, like a cat making off with a fish.\n“Mother?” Chie heard Naomi’s low voice and\nturned from the door. “He has asked you?”\nThe sight of Naomi’s clear eyes, her dark brows\ngave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were\npreposterous.\n“Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! He\nthinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to\nAmerica all in the snap of his fingers!”\nChie waited for Naomi’s ripe laughter.\nNaomi was silent. She stood a full half minute\nlooking straight into Chie’s eyes. Finally, she spoke.\n“I met him at my literary meeting.”\nNaomi turned to go back into the house, then\nstopped.\n“Mother.”\n“Yes?”\n“I mean to have him.”\n* a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her\nfamily’s name'),(2,'The term \"Iron Man\" has many connotations, including references to a song, a comic book icon, even a movie. Yet only one definition of the term truly lives up to its name: the Ironman Triathlon held annually in Hawaii a picturesque setting for a challenging race. This grueling race demands amazing physical prowess and the ability to swim, bike, and run a marathon, all in less than 12 hours with no break. Very few individuals are up to the task.Otherwise, Gordon Haller is a notable exception. Growing up in the 1950s, Haller developed an interest in many sports categorized as endurance athletics, and welcomed their grueling physical demands. As he pursued a degree in physics he drove a taxi to pay the bills, but competitive training proved his passion. So when he heard about the race in 1978, the first year it was held, he immediately signed up.\n\nThe race somewhat originated in an amusing way. The members of two popular sports clubs, the Mid-Pacific Road Runners of Honolulu, and the Waikiki Swim Club of Oahu, had a long-standing and good-natured debate going over who made better athletes: runners or swimmers. However, some local bikers thought both clubs were wrong, while claiming that they, in fact, deserved the title. Wanting to settle the dispute once and for all, when they decided to combine three separate races already held annually on the island into one massive test of endurance. Thus, the Waikiki Roughwater Swim of 2.4 miles, the Around-Oahu Bike race of 112 miles, and the Honolulu Marathon of 26.2 miles were all combined to form the Ironman Triathlon.\n\nHaller was one of only fifteen competitors to show up that February morning to start the race. He quickly scanned the few pages of rules and instructions, and while reading those pages on the last page he discovered a sentence that would become the race\\'s famous slogan: \"Swim 2.4 miles! Bike 112 miles! Run 26.2 miles! Brag for the rest of your life!\" Haller took that to heart, and at the end of the day, he had became the first Ironman champion in history.\n\n\n\n\nIn the approximately thirty years since that very first race, the Ironman has become a tradition in Hawaii and now boasts approximately 1,500 entrants every year. The competitors14 who complete the race don\\'t have to be the first across the finish line to claim success: just finishing is a victory unto itself.\n');''')
